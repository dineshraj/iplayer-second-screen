Repo for a Web Socket driven iPlayer second screen hack


Running the app
----------------

Currently you'll need to run the following to get it working locally

<pre><code>cd path/to/client/folder</code></pre>
<pre><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></pre>

And then you should be up and running with data from the fixtures folder (currenly only PID b01skh8t)
